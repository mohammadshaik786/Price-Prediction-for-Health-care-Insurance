About the Project:

The research of the project is about to find out the areas or factors that are resulting in the increase in Health care costs. The main objective is to predict a patient’s healthcare costs depending upon the features. To identify factors contributing to this prediction, with a particular focus on the role of pharmacotherapy. Required dataset will be obtained from Medical Cost Personal Datasets (USA) which is nothing but the Health Insurance Data with 1338 observations and 7 features with attributes like Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker, Region, Charges. The regression analysis is performed to determine the relationship among two or more exploratory variables with cause-effect relationships and to make predictions for the topic using the relationships. If regression used one independent variable, then it is known as Simple Linear Regression Model, or else if it used more than two or more independent variables then it is known as Multilinear Regression Model. Data Ingestion, Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning & Preprocessing, EDA will be done before Data Modeling depending upon the dataset. Basically, for any Machine Learning problem, multiple models will be built on the top of the dataset and based upon the accuracy of each model and the model with the highest accuracy will be considered and it will be evaluated on the test data. But to decide which model best fits the data, first analysis must be done on the dataset where “charges” will be the Dependent Variable which is target feature and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) must be done to find the Independent Variables by analyzing the correlation or plotting the relationship between each feature with respect to target feature. Hence, the econometric model that will be used for this research is Multilinear Regression Model as it has more than two exploratory variables. Evaluation of metrics helps to find how well the model generalizes the prediction.
